# Minecraft Lua Scripts
Welcome to the Minecraft Lua Scripts Framework! This mod provides a Lua-based scripting environment that enables players to automate tasks and create custom systems in Minecraft. Whether you're working on a new map, managing a server, or designing your own minigames, this framework gives you the flexibility to create dynamic, interactive experiences without the limitations of vanilla gameplay.

## Introduction

### Key Features:
 - **Enhance Map Creation**: Add complex, automated systems and behaviors to your maps—perfect for custom adventures, puzzles, and challenges.
 - **Server Management**: Automate server maintenance tasks such as player teleportation, dynamic permissions adjustment, event-triggered actions, and in-game announcements.
 - **Create Custom Minigames**: Build unique minigames that feature automated triggers, events, and actions, all controlled by scripts.

### Why Lua:
Lua is lightweight, flexible, and user-friendly, making it ideal for adding custom automation without bogging down performance. It offers a perfect balance for both beginners and experienced users—whether you're just starting out or designing sophisticated systems, Lua gives you the power to shape your Minecraft experience.
### What this Mod is NOT:
This framework is not designed to replace or cheat the Minecraft experience. Instead, it enhances the gameplay by adding new layers of interaction and automation, perfect for players who want to customize and streamline their in-game tasks.
### Who Is This Mod For:
 - Map Creators: Add dynamic elements, automate puzzle mechanics, or control events in your maps without the constraints of redstone.
 - Server Owners: Automate management tasks, player interactions, and world features to keep your server running smoothly.
 - Minigame Designers: Build intricate, automated minigames with custom rules, triggers, and actions.

### Planning Features:
Realistic Goals:
 - [ ] Add more functions for entities
 - [ ] Introduce player-related functions
 - [ ] Improve Lua error messages
 - [ ] Implement I/O functions
 - [ ] Write a comprehensive `Quick Start Guide`
 - [ ] Cleanup the code

Long-Term Goals:
 - [ ] Support for Minecraft versions 1.12.x and 1.17.x+
 - [ ] Develop a **Fabric** version
 - [ ] Evaluate the necessity of expanding to **Spigot** or **Bukkit** platforms (currently uncertain)
> While **setters** are currently not a priority (since most can be achieved via commands), focus is on expanding **getters** functionality for now.
